# How to Connect to GoodWe


**Step 1: SEMS account required**

To access the GoodWe SEMS API, you need a SEMS account (with username/email address and password). If you do not have a SEMS account yet, you must first create one.

To obtain API access, please send a request to GoodWe. It is best to contact your GoodWe sales representative who sold you the hardware.

**Step 3: Sign the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**

After receiving your request, GoodWe will send you a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Please sign and return this agreement to GoodWe.

**Step 4: API access enabled**

Upon receipt of the signed NDA, GoodWe will enable API permission for your SEMS account.

In addition to your SEMS account (email address and password), you do not need any further access data to use the API.

If you need support after activating the API permission, please contact [GoodWe After-Sales Support](https://en.goodwe.com/contact-us).

**Step 5: Configure the data source**

Click on "Add access", enter the reuquired infomation:
- Username: Email address of the SEMS account
- Password (non-encrypted): Password of the SEMS account. 

After your GoodWe device is online, it might take 5-10 minutes before you can see the device sn under the GoodWe device list.
