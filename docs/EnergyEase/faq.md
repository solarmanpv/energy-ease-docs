# FAQ

## “User does not exist” or “Account or password error” during login

1. Make sure the account you entered (email/phone number) is correct.  
2. Check whether your password is case-sensitive. If you've forgotten your password, tap **“Forgot your password”** on the login page to reset it.

## What if I don’t receive the verification code?

1. If you’re using phone verification, check whether SMS blocking or filtering is enabled on your device.  
2. If you’re using email verification, check your spam/junk folder in case the message was filtered incorrectly.

## How do I delete my account?

Account deletion is irreversible. Please proceed with caution. For detailed steps, see [Account Deletion](./profile.md#13-delete-account).

## What should I do if my device appears offline?

1. Check that the device is powered on, the indicator lights are normal, and the Wi-Fi network it’s connected to is working properly.  
2. On the Device page, long-press the device card and tap **WLAN** to reconfigure the network: see **[Network Setup](./add-device.md#step-3-configure-the-network)**.  
3. If configuration fails, restart the device: fully power it off, wait 30 seconds, and then turn it back on.
