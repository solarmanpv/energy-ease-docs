# How to get SolarEdge API Key and Site ID

There are three options to get SolarEdge API Key and Site ID:

- **Option 1**: Get them yourself by logging in to your [SolarEdge monitoring account](https://monitoring.solaredge.com/).
- **Option 2**: Contact your installer by email and ask them to grant you admin access or provide your API Key and Site ID.
- **Option 3**: Request the information from [SolarEdge chat support](https://www.solaredge.com/us/support).

## Option 1: Get them yourself

**Step 1**

Log in to your [SolarEdge monitoring account](https://monitoring.solaredge.com/).

**Step 2**

If your account has **Admin** permissions, an **Admin** link will appear in the top menu. Click it to access the **Admin** area.

  <summary>**Problem**: I don’t see the “Admin” menu item! If this is the case, move on to **Option 2**.</summary>

  **Solution**: You can either:
  - _(preferred)_ Request “Admin access” to your account by emailing your installer. 
  - Ask your installer to retrieve and send you your **API Key**. You can send them a link to this page in case they don’t know how to.

**Step 3**

Once you’re in the **Admin** area, click **Site Access**, then **Access Control**. Refer to the screenshot below.

**Step 4**

- Scroll down to the “API Access” area.
- **Check the box** "I have read, understood…".
- **Click Save**.
- After clicking save, click the "Ok" box that pops up.
- To copy the **entire API Key**, double-click on the long key code. Copy and paste it.
- Copy the **Site ID**.

**Step 5**

You’ve done it! You can paste the **API Key** or **Site ID** into the required fields in the Energy Ease App. 

:::note
1. if you ever click “New key” it may break an existing API connection that is working. If that’s the case, you may need to re-send the new API Key.
2. To avoid triggering API rate limits and ensure your device data can be updated normally, please refrain from using the same API across multiple applications.
3. After **API Key** or **Site ID** is filled and SolarEdge device is online, you might need to wait for 5-10 minutes to see the device SN under SolarEdge device list.
